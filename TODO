- There's a vertical scrollbar on seemingly all pages even though there is no need for it

- Uploaded text file (via ShareX) does not show up in the dashboard's "Files" area
	* Currently only pictures show up on the dashboard due to having thumbs

- When you delete a file from the grid view, it's not removed from the list
- When you are on the table view of files, the column `Albums` doesn't get populated unless you fetch them, obviously.
	- Think of a strategy to achieve this in a nice manner

- Can't delete/rename albums when going into album view. Or ever.
- Dark theme the annoying popups for deleting and other stuff
- Logout button
